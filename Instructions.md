1. Make a **class** called `Colour` which contains integer variables red, green and blue. Make a **constructor** which takes three `int` variables to set up red, green and blue.
2. Now make another **constructor** which takes a `string` and sets up the colour accordingly:

|Constructor String|Red|Green|Blue|
|---|---|---|---|
|black|0|0|0|
|red|255|0|0|
|green|0|255|0|
|blue|0|0|255|
|white|255|255|255|

3. Make a **method** called `darker` in `Colour` which multiplies `red`, `green` and `blue` values by `0.8`. 
4. Make a corresponding `lighter` **method** which multiplies `red`, `green` and `blue` values by `1.2`.
5. Modify `main` to test `darker` and `lighter`.
